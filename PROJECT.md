# TENDs × Earth Cafe — Full Project Brief

This document covers everything built to set up this project end-to-end. Use it to onboard Claude (or a developer) on a different computer with zero context loss.

---

## What This Is

A QR code activation for a brand collab between **TENDS™** (small-breed dog nutrition) and **Earth Cafe** (Mumbai). Cafe visitors scan a QR code, land on a mobile page, fill in their dog's details, and claim a free TENDS pop. Their data is simultaneously saved to Airtable and added to a Klaviyo marketing list.

A separate analytics dashboard shows real-time engagement metrics pulled live from Airtable — no dummy data, everything is computed fresh on every page load.

---

## Local Folder Structure

Everything you need is in one zippable folder:

```
C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\TENDs & Earth\
│
├── index.html          ← The entire activation site (HTML + CSS + JS, one self-contained file)
├── dashboard.html      ← Local copy of the analytics dashboard (same as tends-analytics.vercel.app)
├── PROJECT.md          ← This file
├── vercel.json         ← Serverless function timeout config
│
└── api\
    ├── submit.js       ← Form submission handler → Airtable + Klaviyo
    └── pageview.js     ← Page visit logger → Airtable Visits table (fires on every page load)
```

Analytics dashboard (separate Vercel project, separate folder):
```
C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\tends-analytics\
│
├── index.html          ← Dashboard UI (Chart.js, all data from /api/data)
├── vercel.json         ← Serverless function config
│
└── api\
    └── data.js         ← Reads Airtable Leads + Visits, returns aggregated JSON
```

> The `TENDs & Earth` folder is the one to zip and carry. It contains `dashboard.html` as a local copy so you have everything in one place.

## Vercel Projects

| Project | ID | Production URL |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| tends-earth | prj_EKHs6vCbABYG7fLpyT6qXx9XUaBY | https://tends-earth.vercel.app |
| tends-analytics | prj_zlFkNoBznDkkMKeFFE3UuD7bTUBO | https://tends-analytics.vercel.app |

Team/Org ID: `team_9p4dhjKDbueLytAO43HQ71xk`

### Deploying from a new computer
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login   # log in with abhimahamkali@gmail.com

# Activation page
cd "TENDs & Earth"
vercel link --yes --project tends-earth
vercel deploy --prod

# Analytics dashboard
cd tends-analytics
vercel link --yes --project tends-analytics
vercel deploy --prod
```

> ⚠️ The folder name "TENDs & Earth" (spaces + ampersand) will cause `vercel deploy` to fail if the project isn't linked first. Always run `vercel link` before deploying from a fresh clone.

---

## Environment Variables

Already set in Vercel — only needed again if re-creating the projects from scratch.

### tends-earth
| Variable | Where to find it |
|----------|-----------------|
| `AIRTABLE_PAT` | airtable.com → Account → Developer Hub → Personal access tokens → "TENDs × Earth — Leads" |
| `KLAVIYO_PRIVATE_KEY` | klaviyo.com → Settings → API Keys → Private API Key |
| `KLAVIYO_LIST_ID` | `T2KazS` — visible in the URL at klaviyo.com/list/T2KazS |

### tends-analytics
| Variable | Where to find it |
|----------|-----------------|
| `AIRTABLE_PAT` | same token as above |

> 🔐 Credentials are intentionally omitted from this file. Retrieve them from Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables on the existing projects.

To re-add an env var without BOM corruption (use Bash, not PowerShell):
```bash
printf 'YOUR_VALUE_HERE' | vercel env add VARIABLE_NAME production --yes
```

> ⚠️ PowerShell `echo` adds a BOM character (U+FEFF) which breaks API auth headers silently. Always use Bash `printf`.

### Airtable PAT scopes required
The PAT needs **both** scopes — not just one:
- `data.records:read` — required by `api/data.js` (analytics dashboard reads all leads + visits)
- `data.records:write` — required by `api/submit.js` and `api/pageview.js` (form saves leads, page load saves visits)

If the dashboard shows empty KPIs and "Loading…" that never resolves, the PAT is missing `data.records:read`. Go to airtable.com/create/tokens → find the token → add the read scope → Save changes. No need to regenerate — the same token value works immediately after saving.

## Airtable

**Account:** abhimahamkali@gmail.com
**Base ID:** `appk6C18dNxzJvss7`
**Base name:** TENDs × Earth — Leads
**Direct link:** https://airtable.com/appk6C18dNxzJvss7

### Table: Leads (`tblco5qGhwJ7zePbo`)

One row per form submission.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Owner Name | Text | Person's own name |
| Dog Name | Text | |
| WhatsApp | Text | E.164 format — auto-prefixed with +91 |
| Age | Text | Dog's age in years |
| Weight (kg) | Text | Value from 1–10 dropdown |
| Activity Level | Text | One of: mostly-calm / playful-normal / very-active |
| Outlet | Single select | `typecast: true` — auto-creates new options on the fly |
| Source | Text | From `?src=` URL param, defaults to 'earth-cafe-qr' |
| Consent | Checkbox | Always true (form blocks submit without it) |
| Submitted At | DateTime | ISO timestamp (UTC) |

> ⚠️ `Owner Name` and `Activity Level` were added to the form after the table was created. If these columns don't exist in Airtable yet, add them manually (Text type) so the data saves correctly.

### Table: Visits (`tblpMxC5UeXyQuU5E`)

One row per page load on tends-earth.vercel.app. Fired immediately on page open — **completely independent of form submission**. This is what powers the "Total Visitors" KPI in the dashboard, which is always higher than leads.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Timestamp | DateTime | IST timezone |
| Outlet | Text | From `?outlet=` URL param (blank if direct link) |
| Source | Text | From `?src=` URL param |
| Date | Text | YYYY-MM-DD |

---

## Klaviyo

**Account:** abhimahamkali@gmail.com
**List:** Earth Cafe × TENDS (`T2KazS`)
**Direct link:** https://www.klaviyo.com/list/T2KazS

Profiles are upserted by phone number (deduped — same phone = same profile updated, not duplicated). Custom properties stored:
- `owner_name`, `dog_name`, `dog_age`, `dog_weight`, `activity_level`
- `outlet`, `source`, `partner` (always "Earth Cafe")

**API pattern (two-step — important):**
1. `POST /api/profiles/` — upsert profile with custom properties. Returns 201 (new) or 409 (existing — profile ID is in `errors[0].meta.duplicate_profile_id`)
2. `POST /api/lists/T2KazS/relationships/profiles/` — add profile ID to list. Returns 204.

This two-step approach bypasses Klaviyo's SMS consent configuration requirement, which blocks the simpler bulk-subscribe endpoint for phone-only profiles.

Phone numbers are auto-normalised in `api/submit.js`:
```js
const phone = rawPhone.startsWith('+') ? rawPhone : '+91' + rawPhone.replace(/^0+/, '');
// 9876543210 → +919876543210
// 09876543210 → +919876543210
// +919876543210 → +919876543210
```

## How the Activation Page Works (`index.html`)

### On page load (before any interaction)
1. Reads `?outlet=` and `?src=` URL params
2. Immediately fires `POST /api/pageview` — logs the visit to Airtable (visitor counted whether or not they submit)
3. Pre-selects the matching outlet chip if `?outlet=` is in the URL

### Page sections (top to bottom)
1. **Hero** — Earth Cafe × TENDS lockup, tagline
2. **Pillars** — "Small-Breed Only" and "Plant-Powered" value prop cards
3. **Outlet chips** — "Where did you spot us?" selector (Bandra Waterfield, Juhu, Bandra BKC, Churchgate, Lower Parel)
4. **Lead capture form** — see fields below
5. **Success state** — shown after submit ("You're all set / Don't forget your free pop")
6. **Footer** — tendsmall.com | @tendsmall (single line)

### Form fields (current version)
1. Your name (owner's name)
2. Your dog's name
3. Dog's age (dropdown: 1–9 years) + Dog's weight in kg (dropdown: 1–10)
4. Activity level (dropdown, matching TENDS feeding calculator):
   - `mostly-calm` → Mostly Calm — Quiet lifestyle, mostly indoors
   - `playful-normal` → Playful / Normal — Daily walks + regular play
   - `very-active` → Very Active — Long walks, runs, high energy
5. WhatsApp number
6. Consent checkbox ("It's okay for TENDS to reach out")

### On form submit
- Validates: phone ≥ 7 digits, consent checked
- Shows success screen immediately (fire-and-forget — doesn't block on API)
- `POST /api/submit` runs server-side in parallel:
  1. Normalises phone to E.164 (+91...)
  2. Saves full record to Airtable Leads table
  3. Upserts Klaviyo profile with dog data
  4. Adds profile to Earth Cafe × TENDS list

### QR URL format
Each outlet gets its own QR pointing to:
```
https://tends-earth.vercel.app/?outlet=juhu&src=earth-cafe-qr
https://tends-earth.vercel.app/?outlet=bandra-waterfield&src=earth-cafe-qr
https://tends-earth.vercel.app/?outlet=bandra-bkc&src=earth-cafe-qr
https://tends-earth.vercel.app/?outlet=churchgate&src=earth-cafe-qr
https://tends-earth.vercel.app/?outlet=lower-parel&src=earth-cafe-qr
```
The `outlet` param pre-selects the chip and is stored as attribution on both the lead and the visit.

## How the Analytics Dashboard Works (`tends-analytics.vercel.app`)

### Architecture
- Single HTML file (`index.html`) with Chart.js 4.4.0 (CDN)
- On every page load: fetches `GET /api/data` (serverless function)
- `/api/data` reads Airtable Leads + Visits tables (paginates through all records), computes aggregates, returns JSON
- Dashboard renders everything from the response — **zero hardcoded values in the HTML**
- Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds

### What `/api/data` returns
```json
{
  "leads": [...],         // last 20, newest first (for the table)
  "totalLeads": 6,
  "totalVisits": 12,
  "outletMap": { "Juhu": 3, "Bandra Waterfield": 2, ... },
  "leadsByDate": { "2026-06-26": 3, ... },
  "visitsByDate": { "2026-06-26": 5, ... },
  "byHour": [0,0,0,...],  // 24-element array, UTC hours
  "activityMap": { "mostly-calm": 2, ... }
}
```

### Dashboard sections
| Section | Data source |
|---------|-------------|
| Total Visitors KPI | `totalVisits` |
| Leads Captured KPI | `totalLeads` |
| Conversion Rate KPI | `totalLeads / totalVisits × 100` |
| Top Outlet KPI | Highest count in `outletMap` (excludes Unknown) |
| Daily Visitors vs Leads chart | `visitsByDate` + `leadsByDate` |
| Outlet Attribution donut | `outletMap` |
| Outlet Leaderboard | `outletMap` sorted descending |
| Conversion Funnel | `totalVisits` → `totalLeads` (2-step, real data only) |
| Time of day bar chart | `byHour` (converted to IST, grouped into 2h slots) |
| Recent Leads table | `leads` array, last 10, phone masked |

## Key Technical Fixes Made (important for future debugging)

### BOM in Vercel env vars
**Problem:** PowerShell `echo "value" | vercel env add` prepends U+FEFF (byte-order mark) silently. This caused `ByteString character at index 7 has value 65279` errors in API calls.
**Fix:** Always use Bash `printf 'value' | vercel env add VARNAME production --yes`

### Klaviyo phone-only profiles blocked by SMS config
**Problem:** `POST /api/lists/{id}/profile-subscription-bulk-create-jobs` requires SMS account configuration when the profile has no email — threw "SMS or WhatsApp configuration is required."
**Fix:** Split into two calls: create profile first (`POST /api/profiles/`), then add to list via relationship endpoint (`POST /api/lists/{id}/relationships/profiles/`). The relationship endpoint has no consent requirement.

### Airtable single-select rejects unknown options
**Problem:** Outlet field was a single-select with predefined options. Submitting "churchgate" (not in the list) caused a 422 error, silently dropping the Airtable save.
**Fix:** Add `typecast: true` to the Airtable POST body — it auto-creates new select options.

### Dashboard showing dummy data / empty KPIs
**Problem 1:** All KPI values, funnel numbers, outlet leaderboard, and the recent leads table (Bruno, Mochi, etc.) were hardcoded in the HTML. The JS was writing to element IDs that didn't exist, so the real data never replaced the fake rows.
**Fix:** Added IDs to every dynamic element. All hardcoded HTML rows removed. JS populates everything from `/api/data`.

**Problem 2:** Even after the JS fix, KPIs showed "—" and the table showed "Loading…" because the Airtable PAT only had `data.records:write` scope — it could save records but not read them back.
**Fix:** Updated the existing PAT at airtable.com/create/tokens to add `data.records:read` scope. Same token, no regeneration needed.

### Dashboard JS silently broken (duplicate `const` declaration)
**Problem:** `const allDates` was declared twice in `loadData()` — once for the subtitle, once for the traffic chart. This is a `SyntaxError` that prevents the entire `<script>` block from parsing, so no JS ran at all. KPIs showed "—" and charts showed "Loading…" indefinitely.
**Fix:** Renamed the first occurrence to `subtitleDates`.

### Edge cache serving stale empty data
**Problem:** `api/data.js` had `Cache-Control: s-maxage=60` — Vercel's edge was caching the API response for 60s. Visits written to Airtable wouldn't appear on the dashboard until the cache expired.
**Fix:** Changed to `Cache-Control: no-store` so every `/api/data` request hits Airtable fresh.

### Outlet casing mismatch
**Problem:** "juhu" (from URL param) and "Juhu" (manually entered) were counted as separate outlets in the dashboard.
**Fix:** Outlet names are now title-cased in `api/data.js` before aggregation.

### Vercel deploy fails on folder with special characters
**Problem:** `vercel deploy` inside "TENDs & Earth" failed due to `&` and spaces in folder name.
**Fix:** Run `vercel link --yes --project tends-earth` first to create the `.vercel/project.json` binding, then `vercel deploy --prod` works.

## CSS Design Tokens (activation page)

```css
--navy:    #1B2A4A   /* dark blue — hero background, offer card */
--cream:   #FBF7EC   /* page background */
--gold:    #CD3A54   /* red/rose — CTAs, accents, kicker labels */
--gold-dk: #a82e45   /* darker red — hover states */
--sage:    #6E8A7F   /* muted green — success/confirmation text */
--mute:    #7a7468   /* grey — secondary text */
```

Font: **Gambarino** (display/serif), embedded as base64 woff2 inside the `<style>` block. Do not remove — it's not loaded from a CDN.
Layout: mobile-first, max-width 480px.

## What's Still Left To Do

- [ ] Add `Owner Name` and `Activity Level` columns to Airtable Leads table (Text type) if not already there
- [ ] Design Klaviyo welcome flow: Day 0 welcome → Day 3 breed/activity education → Day 7 first purchase offer
- [ ] Brief all 5 outlet staff on the QR code + free pop redemption script
- [x] Connect Vercel GitHub integration — `git push` to `main` now auto-deploys both projects (done via `vercel git connect`)
- [x] Add `Owner Name` and `Activity Level` columns to Airtable Leads table (created via Airtable MCP)
- [x] Dog's age changed to dropdown (1–9 years) matching weight and activity level style
- [x] Spacing adjusted: larger gap above "Where did you spot us?" chips, tighter gap below it (closer to form)
- [ ] Once enough real data accumulates (~50+ visits), use the dashboard to identify the top-converting outlet and replicate its setup at others
